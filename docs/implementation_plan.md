### Architecture Components

1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated network environment with public and private subnets
   - Public subnets for load balancers and API Gateway
   - Private subnets for application servers and database

2. **EC2 Instance**: Hosts the FastAPI application (t2.micro for Free Tier)
   - Runs the containerized Python application
   - Handles API requests, authentication, and business logic

3. **RDS PostgreSQL**: Managed database service (db.t3.micro for Free Tier)
   - Stores user data and file metadata
   - Managed by AWS for high availability and backups

4. **S3 Bucket**: Object storage for file data
   - Stores actual file contents (up to 5GB in Free Tier)
   - Accessible via presigned URLs generated by the API

5. **API Gateway (Optional)**: Manages API endpoint access
   - Provides API key management and rate limiting
   - Offers SSL termination and request/response transformations

6. **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability
   - Collects logs from application and AWS services
   - Tracks metrics and triggers alerts

7. **Route 53 (Optional)**: DNS management
   - Handles domain name resolution
   - Can be used for health checks and routing policies

8. **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
   - Automates testing, building, and deployment
   - Manages infrastructure updates via Terraform

### Data Flow

1. Users authenticate with the API through API Gateway
2. The FastAPI application processes requests and authenticates users
3. For uploads:
   - The API generates a presigned S3 URL
   - User uploads directly to S3 via the presigned URL
   - File metadata is stored in PostgreSQL
4. For downloads:
   - The API verifies user permissions
   - The API generates a presigned S3 URL for download
   - User downloads directly from S3 via the presigned URL

## Phase 1: Local Development

  - Configure alerting via SNS or other notification channels
  - Implement dead letter queues for failed operations

### Step 3: Performance Optimization
- **Learning Objective**: Learn how to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
  - Optimize database queries and connections
  - Fine-tune AWS resource allocation to stay within Free Tier while maximizing performance
  - Create performance benchmarks and testing procedures

## Free Tier Considerations

Throughout implementation, we'll carefully consider AWS Free Tier limitations:

- **EC2**: Use t2.micro instance (750 hours/month free)
- **RDS**: Use db.t3.micro with minimal storage (750 hours/month free)
- **S3**: Stay under 5GB standard storage
- **Data Transfer**: Minimize cross-AZ traffic to reduce costs
- **CloudWatch**: Stay within the basic monitoring metrics and limit custom metrics
- **API Gateway**: Limit to 1 million requests per month to stay in free tier
- **NAT Gateway**: Avoid using NAT Gateway as it has no free tier

## Next Steps and Extensions

After completing the core implementation, consider these enhancements:

1. Implement user authentication with AWS Cognito
2. Add file versioning and restore capabilities
3. Implement file preview generation for common file types
4. Create a simple frontend application for demonstration
5. Add virus scanning for uploaded files
6. Implement file encryption at rest and in transit
