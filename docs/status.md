# Project Status

## Current Progress
- Repository structure initialized
- FastAPI application code implemented with:
  - User and file models
  - Authentication with JWT
  - File metadata CRUD operations
  - Presigned URL generation for uploads and downloads
- Local development environment set up with Docker Compose
- Terraform modules created:
  - VPC with public and private subnets
  - S3 for file storage
  - EC2 for API deployment (t2.micro for free tier)
  - RDS PostgreSQL for database (db.t3.micro for free tier)
- CI with GitHub Actions:
  - Comprehensive CI workflow with linting, testing, and Docker build stages
  - Terraform validation integrated in CI pipeline
  - terraform-docs added to CI environment for documentation checks
- Pre-commit hooks configured for code quality enforcement:
  - Python linting with Ruff
  - Terraform formatting, validation, and documentation
  - Git commit message validation
- System architecture diagram added to implementation plan document
- Project structure reorganized:
  - Moved Dockerfile and pyproject.toml to top level
  - Moved app directory from api/app to top level
  - Switched from hatchling to setuptools for more reliable builds
  - Added proper package configuration and basic tests
  - Updated CI workflow to use simplified dependency installation
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to reflect the new structure
  - Updated README.md with the correct directory structure
- Linting configuration improved:
  - Added appropriate rule exceptions for FastAPI-specific patterns
  - Fixed docstring format issues
  - Fixed class method parameter name issues
  - Restored Terraform checks to ensure infrastructure quality
  - Temporarily disabled strict linting rules for gradual code cleanup
- Development setup improved:
  - Added comprehensive development guide (docs/development.md)
  - Enhanced error handling with virtual environment checks

## Next Steps
- Add unit and integration tests
- Set up monitoring with CloudWatch
- Implement CI/CD for multiple environments
- Add API documentation
- Create a simple frontend application
- Fix remaining type checking and linting issues
- Gradually address linting issues that were temporarily disabled

## Completed Items
- Project structure creation
- Documentation setup
- FastAPI application setup
- Database models and schemas creation
- API endpoints implementation
- Docker and Docker Compose setup
- Terraform module creation
- GitHub Actions workflow setup
- Pre-commit hooks installation and configuration
- System architecture diagram creation and documentation
- Project restructuring to adhere to standard Python package format
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline improvements
- Linting configuration improvements
- Basic type checking fixes
- Development environment documentation

## Issues
- Type checking errors need to be addressed systematically
- Linting issues need to be addressed gradually after getting a stable CI pipeline
