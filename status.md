- ✅ Create API endpoints for file upload/download
- ✅ Implement S3 integration for file storage
- ✅ Set up Docker containerization
- ✅ Create Terraform configuration for AWS deployment
- ✅ Deploy to AWS
- ✅ Fix S3 integration issues in AWS environment
- ✅ Improve S3 integration with enhanced region and credential handling

## Current Status
The application is now fully functional in both local and AWS environments. File uploads and downloads are working correctly with AWS S3. All major functionality is working as expected. The S3 integration has been enhanced to prevent region and credential issues in future deployments.

## S3 Integration Fix Details
Fixed the following S3 integration issues in the AWS environment:
1. Region mismatch: Updated AWS region from us-east-1 to ap-south-1 to match the bucket's actual region
2. Credentials: Removed explicit MinIO credentials to utilize EC2 instance role instead
3. Signature version: Updated the S3 client to use signature version 4 (s3v4)
4. Bucket name: Ensured correct bucket name format from Terraform was used in the environment variables

## S3 Integration Improvements
Enhanced the S3 integration to prevent future issues:
1. Added proper signature version (s3v4) configuration for all regions
2. Added a new setting (`USE_INSTANCE_ROLE`) to explicitly control the use of EC2 instance roles
3. Improved credential handling to safely fall back to instance roles when appropriate
4. Enhanced region configuration by ensuring it's consistently set in both client object and session config
5. Refactored presigned URL generation to use consistent parameters
6. Updated the Terraform EC2 user data script to set the correct environment variables

## Next Steps
- Implement additional file format validations
- Add user profile management
- Create a frontend interface
- Implement advanced file sharing features
- Add monitoring and logging
- Create CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
