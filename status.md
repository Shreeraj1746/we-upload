- ✅ Add end-to-end test for file upload/download functionality
- ✅ Configure CI/CD to run e2e tests on each push

## Current Status
The application is now fully functional in both local and AWS environments. File uploads and downloads are working correctly with AWS S3. All major functionality is working as expected. The S3 integration has been enhanced to prevent region and credential issues in future deployments. API integration tests have been added to verify the API endpoints functionality, and the CI/CD pipeline has been updated to run these tests on each push. The test infrastructure has been fixed to properly manage Docker Compose for integration testing.

## S3 Integration Fix Details
Fixed the following S3 integration issues in the AWS environment:
1. Region mismatch: Updated AWS region from us-east-1 to ap-south-1 to match the bucket's actual region
2. Credentials: Removed explicit MinIO credentials to utilize EC2 instance role instead
3. Signature version: Updated the S3 client to use signature version 4 (s3v4)
4. Bucket name: Ensured correct bucket name format from Terraform was used in the environment variables

## S3 Integration Improvements
Enhanced the S3 integration to prevent future issues:
1. Added proper signature version (s3v4) configuration for all regions
2. Added a new setting (`USE_INSTANCE_ROLE`) to explicitly control the use of EC2 instance roles
3. Improved credential handling to safely fall back to instance roles when appropriate
4. Enhanced region configuration by ensuring it's consistently set in both client object and session config
5. Refactored presigned URL generation to use consistent parameters
6. Updated the Terraform EC2 user data script to set the correct environment variables

## Testing Improvements
Added comprehensive testing:
1. Created API integration tests that verify endpoint functionality without S3 upload/download
2. Updated the GitHub Actions CI workflow to run tests on every push
3. Implemented Docker Compose management in tests to ensure a consistent environment
4. Added cleanup procedures to maintain a clean state
5. Added detailed documentation on running tests in the README
6. Fixed the pytest fixture for Docker Compose management, ensuring proper environment setup/teardown for tests
7. Consolidated redundant Docker Compose fixtures into a single, more robust implementation

## Next Steps
- Implement additional file format validations
- Add user profile management
- Create a frontend interface
- Implement advanced file sharing features
- Add monitoring and logging
- Create CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
